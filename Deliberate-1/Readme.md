# Deliberate Practice Initial Session


## The whole idea is to train everyday.
### While training I will be wide open to different things where to improve as well places to develop a clear training reproducible step.

## What we're going to build?

We are going to build a simple App to consume a list of Headlines and show it on screen in a TableView.

## Where to start?

We are going to start with the view.
Our view will be based on a TableView and it should display:

- A list of articles.
- Each Article contains: 
    - source
        - id
        - name
    - title
    - description
    - url
    - urlToImage
    - publishedAt
    - content
 
 
 ## After that we can start to develop the Networking Layer
